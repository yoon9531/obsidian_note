Shared memory : cache like memory, controlled by software, avoid bank conflict
Coalescing : spatial locality multiple different memory access

CUDA memory
- register (read/write)
- shared memory (read/write)
- global memory (read/write)
- constant memory (read only)

GPU cache는 SM의 모든 thread에 관한 데이터를 저장하기에는 너무 작다.

Maximize usage of register : use local variable
- `sum += M(i,k) * N(k, j)` : output value modified in register
#### Defining Threadblock
- Tiled matrix multiplication
Memory bandwidth
